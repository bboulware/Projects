With every inch of rainfall, Portland’s Green Street planters collect and filter 4.1 million gallons of stormwater runoff and allow it to slowly replenish groundwater levels. During the record rain and snowfall of January 2017, Green Street planters are estimated to have managed 8.2 million gallons of snow, ice, and rain.\n",
