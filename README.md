## About Me 

My name is Bryan Boulware and my formal educational background is in Architecture/Construction Techonology at Wayne State University. During my time at Wayne State University, I had hands on experience with programs such as Word, Excel, AutoCAD, Revit, and Google Sketchup. In my current role as an Interior Trim Repairman at General Motors, communcation and problem solving skills are extremely important for success. In my personal time, I have educated myself on programming launguages such as HTML, CSS, mySQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableau, utilizing educational domains such as Coursera and Udemy, as well as textbooks and mentorships. I am passionate about using data to answer real world problems and am actively increasing my knowledge in domains such as Machine Learning and ETL. One of the things I am looking to achieve is pursuing a career in the video game space as a data analyst for their business, or marketing team.

In the following sections you will learn about the some of the projects that have allowed me to showcase my skill sets not only an anaylst, but also in my understanding of data and its importance to an expanding business.
