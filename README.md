## About Me 

My name is Bryan Boulware and my formal educational background is in Architecture/Construction Techonology at Wayne State University. At my time at Wayne State University, I had hands on experience with programs such as Word, Excel, AutoCADD, Revit, and Google Sketchup. In my current role as an Interior Trim Repairman at General Motors, communcation and problem solving skill are extremely important for sucess. In my personal time, I have educated myself on programming launguages such as HTML, CSS, mySQL, Python, Tableau, utilizing educational domains such as Coursera and Udemy, as well as books and mentorships. I am passionate about using data to answer real world problems and am actively increasing my knowledge in domains such as Machine Learning, ETL, Rust, and Google Carbon. One of the things I am looking to achieve is pursuing a career in the video game space as a data analyst for their business or marketing team.
